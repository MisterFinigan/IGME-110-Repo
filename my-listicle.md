# List of things in history I want to learn more about
- [**The Holy Roman Empire**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Holy_Roman_Empire): A collection of German (and Italian) polities that were nominally subject to one Emperor. This very idea of a confederation of German (and Italian, but mostly German) principalities and the rich history that comes with it is what draws me to it.

- [**The Protestant Reformation**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reformation): A widespread religious movement that sought to break away from the Catholic Church as a result of its rampant corruption.

- [**The Thirty Years' War**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thirty_Years%27_War): A war that brought about great destruction onto Germany and the HRE as a result of religious conflicts between Protestant and Catholic states in Europe. Such a devastating, apocolyptic, and influential war needs no explanation for why it interests me.

_I'm starting to see a trend here_

- [**The History of Switzerland**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_Switzerland): It seems like such a random place to be interested in, but the history of how the Swiss Confederation came to be and its existence throughout the [Early Modern Period](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Early_modern_period) is certainly fascinating.

- [**The Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polishâ€“Lithuanian_Commonwealth): A union between the Kingdom of Poland and the massive and suprisingly powerful [Grand Duchy of Lithuania](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grand_Duchy_of_Lithuania).

I think you have also begun to notice the trend towards Early Modern Central European History, as I have writing this. This requires further study.

# Reading List
I am currently reading a [book](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/8469553-1848?ref=nav_sb_ss_1_9) about the [1848 Revolutions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Revolutions_of_1848) which I am getting close to finishing should classes (and my EU4 Addiction) not take up all of my time.

If you have any reading suggestions please let me know!

## Reformation
